## Challenge
This challenge involves a form allowing the user to set up a plan for an online gaming service. The form consists of 5 screens. The
first three prompt the user to input information about themselves and their preferred plan options. The fourth screen displays a summary of
the user's choices along with their total billing cost. The final screen displays a thank you message.

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
